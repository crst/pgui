"""
This folder contains the backend code all the different modules. The
corresponding frontend code can be found in static/pages/[module].js
(if available).

Modules should be added to the PAGES list in index.py, which serves as
a table of contents for the application. Every module implements one
visible html page in a function with the modules name. Modules may add
more "hidden" URL's for frontend interactiviy though.

All layout code that is needed to incorporate modules into the common
UI should be added to shared.py.
